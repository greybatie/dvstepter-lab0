1. Describe the motivations and goals of this experiment. Why is energy calibration of detectors important?

The purpose of this experiment was to provide the opportunity to practice generating lab reports using the reproducible work flow
required for NE 204. Energy calibration of a HPGe detector was used as an example for practicing the work flow. Implementation of
an approach to download data, extract spectral information, and develop a model for energy calibration was necessary to complete
the lab. The energy calibration will then be evaluated using (at least) one of the datasets that was not used in the calibration
procedure.
